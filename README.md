# CsFloat-getting-average-price-of-items
This Python script automatically retrieves and analyzes average market prices for CS2/CS:GO items using the CsFloat API. It fetches both buy orders and historical sold prices, filters out anomalies, and calculates a realistic average price for each item in your list. The results are written to output_prices.txt in USD.
